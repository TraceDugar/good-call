## Description

Tactile, single hand use, phone screen flashlight app with 5 brightness settings. Min - 0% , Dim - 20%, Mid - %50, Bright - 80%, Max - 100%.  Buttons give you haptic feedback whenever pressed. Button placement promotes ambidextrous single handed use. Red was the chosen default because it is the color least visible from a distance.  Additional color choices include Blue, Green, and White.  The fact that the screen is the light will use less battery than the camera flashlight.

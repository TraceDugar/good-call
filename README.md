## Description

Tactile Screen Flashlight Phone App with a Default Red Background and 5 Settings of brightness Min - 0% , Dim - 20%, Mid - %50, Bright - 80%, Max - 100%.  Buttons give you haptic feedback whenever pressed.  Red was the chosen default because it is the color least visible from a distance.  Additional color choices include Blue, Green, and White for more options.  The Fact that the screen is the light will use less battery than the flashlight.
